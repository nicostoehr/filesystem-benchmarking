# Modular Filesysteme Auto Benchmarking for HPC                MOFAB
This tool provides a framework to build a pipeline for filesystem testing.
MOFAB is portable, modular and can visualize benchmarking results.
Benchmark apps and Filesystems can be build, configured and run automatically.
Profiles provide the modular interface for expantion with other apps and filesystems.
Testing results can then be formed into graphs.

Individual .bashrc configs may be required for this programm to run corretly. Make sure all modules are loaded.
Changes to specified configs might have to be applied.

# Options
Use the run.py and graphs.py interfaces to interact with the program. 
No compilation required. Just git clone this repository.

> run.py
handles all downloading, building and running of the applications.
Run "python3 run.py help" for more information.

> graphs.py 
handles visualizing results.
Run "python3 graphs.py help" for more information.

# Dependencies
Python3 >= 3.6
